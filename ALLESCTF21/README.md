      DotNet challenge. The challenge was pretty straight forward and yet tricky, the challenge implemented a JIT hooking technique to change pieces of code during             runtime, debugging was my way of solving this challenge, but statically analysing the challenge should also work. The core of the challenge was to recreate the           maze and supply the right inputs (which changes during runtime) to the binary, which makes the flag.<br>
